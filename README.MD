### UNIVERSITY OF UYO, AKWAIBOM STATE STUDENTS HACKDEV

I was invited to come speak to students of the computer engineering department on handling large file upload on both the front end and backend.
The `HACK-DEV` event happened from Tuesday 6th December to Thursday 8th December 2022. 


It was a two day speaking event.

We went through the basics of computer science, covering the following

- Bits
- Bytes
- Streams
- files

We used the theorem of 
- chunking files at the front end
- sending those chunks to the server
- assembling the chunks at the server to remake the actual file



##### PICTURES

We definitely took pictures and they can be found in [pictures directories](./pictures)
